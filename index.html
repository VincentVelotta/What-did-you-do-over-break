<h2>What I did</h2>

<p>Over winter break, I spent most of my time relaxing and enjoying a break from school. I caught up on a lot of sleep, which was much needed after a busy semester. I also spent a good amount of time playing Call of Duty, hanging out online and having fun without worrying about homework. In addition, I watched a lot of football, keeping up with both the NFL and the college football playoffs, which were exciting and gave me something to look forward to each day. Overall, winter break was a nice mix of rest, gaming, and watching sports.</p>
